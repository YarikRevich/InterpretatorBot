# InterpretatorBot
Special bot via what you can get the explanation of some Ukrainian words. It's my first written bot on Go ;)

#How to run
-------------------------
You may run it via installing Golang and run command 'go run main.go'

If you want to get already compiled program you should run 'go build main.go' and after run it :)
